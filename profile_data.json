  "summary": "I specialize in data engineering and financial analytics with a focus on building reliable, compliant, and scalable data systems. Over the years, I\u2019ve supported diverse stakeholders\u2014including Finance, FP&A, and Accounting teams\u2014by designing ETL/ELT pipelines, automating reporting workflows, and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards such as SOX, MSB, and tax reporting.\nMy experience includes building integrated data layers (IDL), migrating reporting processes from MSTR to Tellius, and developing dashboards for leadership reporting and pipeline monitoring. I enjoy working at the intersection of finance and technology, helping teams manage budgets, optimize costs, and gain insights through data-driven decision-making.\nI also have hands-on experience in behavior analysis, data quality control, and curated dataset design, ensuring accuracy and reliability in financial reporting. More recently, I\u2019ve been exploring machine learning and large language models\u2014experimenting with Text-to-SQL, RAG, and LangChain\u2014to unlock new ways of interacting with financial data.\nAt my core, I\u2019m passionate about using data to bridge business needs and technical solutions, while continuously improving systems for scalability, compliance, and innovation.\n",
